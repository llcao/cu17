Sign up for a `cloud.cs.columbia.edu` account at [Google Cloud - CS Columbia](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/auth/cloud). Note that is is an entirely new account and is not your normal Columbia account. Your cloud Columbia CS account will be in the form: `yourUNI@cloud.cs.columbia.edu`.

After signing up, you will receive an email including your account ID and temporary password. Log in to your Google Cloud account [HERE](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using a **private browsing window** (this is useful to prevent you from redeeming the coupon to a wrong account). Change your password. 

You will get to this page if success.
